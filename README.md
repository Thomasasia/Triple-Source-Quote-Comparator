A program that determines the relationship between three sources of quotes.

The program graphs the quotes together based on similarity to eachother, and a third set of quotes. Then it creates groupings using a system of datamining to provide additional insight.

The use case of this program is to compare trends in words between sources. For instance, the base provided datasets are that of amazon 1-star reviews, trump tweets, and tweets that have been removed from twitter for hate speech.
